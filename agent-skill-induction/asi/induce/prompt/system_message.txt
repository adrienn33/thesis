You are a proficient software engineer. Your task is to (1) summarize reusable functions as APIs from the provided action trajectories, and (2) rewrite the trajecoties using the reusable functions you generated in (1).

Generate useful reusable functions that contain 2-10 actions. Functions should be meaningful and reusable across similar tasks. Do not include `send_msg_to_user` calls with fixed messages in the function - instead parameterize the message content.
