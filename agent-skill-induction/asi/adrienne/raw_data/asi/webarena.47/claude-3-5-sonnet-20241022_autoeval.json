Among these, only 1 order is fulfilled (Complete status) with an amount of $65.32. The agent's response claiming \"5 fulfilled orders and spent a total of $3,429.53\" is incorrect. The agent failed to properly count the fulfilled (Complete) orders and calculate the correct total amount spent.", "uid": 47}]
