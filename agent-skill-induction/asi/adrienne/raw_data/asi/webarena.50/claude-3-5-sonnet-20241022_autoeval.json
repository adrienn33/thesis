[{"idx": 50, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "This is an information seeking task where the user wants to know the number of fulfilled orders and total spending over the past year (from 6/12/2022 to 6/12/2023). Looking at the order history shown in the image, I can see orders from 2/9/23 to 5/17/23, with their status being either Complete, Pending, or Canceled. To calculate fulfilled orders, I should only count \"Complete\" status orders. From the visible orders, there are 4 completed orders (000000157, 000000161, 000000166, 000000180) with total amounts of $185.22, $762.18, $17.99, and $65.32 respectively. However, the agent's response shows different numbers (10 fulfilled orders and $3,500.00) and seems to be stuck in a loop clicking the same element (\"1670\") multiple times. The agent's behavior appears erratic and the numbers provided don't match the actual order history shown in the image.", "uid": 50}]
