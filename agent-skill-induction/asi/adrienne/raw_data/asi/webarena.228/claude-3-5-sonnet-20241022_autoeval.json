[{"idx": 228, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "This appears to be an information seeking task where the user wants to know the price range of Sephora products. The agent repeatedly opens new tabs and navigates to the Sephora page, which seems unnecessary and potentially indicates an issue. The agent provides a response about the price range ($10-$150), but looking at the final webpage snapshot, it appears to be blank or not properly loaded. Without being able to verify the price information from the actual webpage content, and given the suspicious repetitive behavior and blank page, I cannot confirm if the price range provided is accurate.", "uid": 228}]
