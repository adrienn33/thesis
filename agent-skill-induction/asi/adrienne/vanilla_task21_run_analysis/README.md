# Vanilla Baseline Run - Task 21

## Overview
This directory contains all artifacts from a **vanilla baseline** experiment run on WebArena Task 21. This was a control experiment to establish baseline performance before testing any skill induction methods.

## Task Description
**Task 21**: "List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about ear cups being small"
- **Website**: Shopping site (headphones product page)
- **Goal**: Find and list reviewers who mentioned small ear cups in their reviews
- **Expected Reviewers**: Joseph Brzezinski, Catso, Dibbins, Anglebert Dinkherhump, Michelle Davis

## Run Results Summary
- **Success**: ❌ FAILED (task was truncated after 10 steps)
- **Steps Taken**: 10 (hit max step limit)
- **Reward**: 0.0 (task incomplete)
- **Agent**: claude-3-haiku-20240307 (vanilla, no skill induction)

## Directory Structure

### `/config/`
Configuration and setup files:
- `task_definition.json` - Complete task specification including expected answers
- `exp_args.pkl` - Experiment parameters (agent model, settings, etc.)
- `package_versions.txt` - Python environment snapshot

### `/execution_trace/`
Complete execution history:
- `experiment.log` - Human-readable log of all agent actions and thoughts
- `step_0.pkl.gz` through `step_10.pkl.gz` - Complete state snapshots at each step

### `/screenshots/`
Visual evidence of execution:
- `screenshot_step_0.png` through `screenshot_step_10.png` - Browser screenshots at each step
- Shows what the agent was "seeing" at each decision point

### `/results/`
Final outcomes:
- `summary_info.json` - **KEY FILE** - Contains metrics (steps, rewards, success/failure)
- `goal_object.pkl.gz` - Task goal object and evaluation criteria

## Key Findings

### What Went Wrong
1. **Rate Limiting**: Agent hit Anthropic API rate limits (visible in experiment.log)
2. **UI Navigation Issues**: Agent struggled with clicking elements (IndexError: list index out of range)
3. **Repetitive Actions**: Agent got stuck repeating the same failed action
4. **No Success**: Failed to complete the task within 10 steps

### Performance Metrics
- **n_steps**: 10 (maxed out)
- **cum_reward**: 0.0 (failure)
- **terminated**: false (didn't complete successfully)
- **truncated**: true (hit step limit)

### Agent Behavior Analysis
- Agent correctly identified the task (find reviews mentioning small ear cups)
- Successfully clicked on Reviews tab initially
- Got stuck when trying to access specific review content
- Showed repetitive behavior when encountering errors

## How to Analyze These Files

### Quick Analysis
1. **Check success**: Look at `results/summary_info.json` → `"cum_reward": 0.0` = failure
2. **See final state**: Open `screenshots/screenshot_step_10.png`
3. **Read agent reasoning**: Open `execution_trace/experiment.log` and search for "action:"

### Deep Analysis
1. **Step-by-step review**: Look at screenshots 0-10 to see agent's progression
2. **Error analysis**: Search experiment.log for "Error message" or "IndexError"
3. **Rate limit impact**: Count "HTTP Request: POST" vs "429 Too Many Requests" in log

## Comparison Baseline
This vanilla run provides the baseline for comparing:
- **ASI (Agent Skill Induction)** - Does learned skill improve performance?
- **AWM (Agent with Memory)** - Does workflow memory help?
- **Success Rate** - Current: 0% (0/1 tasks completed)
- **Step Efficiency** - Current: >10 steps needed (failed within limit)

## Next Steps
1. Run more vanilla tasks (21-25) to get robust baseline statistics
2. Calculate average success rate and steps for vanilla approach
3. Compare against ASI and other methods from the paper
