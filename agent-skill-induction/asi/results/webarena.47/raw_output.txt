I need to find information about fulfilled orders from the past month and the total amount spent. Let me start by navigating to the My Account section to access order history.

The current page shows the home page of One Stop Market. I can see "My Account" link in the header. I'll click on it to access the account area where I should be able to view my orders.

```click("227")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "My Account" page (as shown in the title and URL). The page displays a "Recent Orders" table with several orders listed.

From what I can see on this page:
- Order 000000170 (5/17/23) - $365.42 - Canceled
- Order 000000189 (5/2/23) - $754.99 - Pending
- Order 000000188 (5/2/23) - $2,004.99 - Pending
- Order 000000187 (5/2/23) - $1,004.99 - Pending
- Order 000000180 (3/11/23) - $65.32 - Complete

However, this is only showing a limited view of recent orders. To get a complete picture of all orders from the past month (since today is 6/12/2023, that would be from 5/12/2023 onwards), I need to click on "View All" to see the full order history.

```click("1416")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the "My Orders" page with a table showing order history. The page displays orders with their dates, totals, and statuses.

Let me analyze what I need to do:
1. Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means orders from 5/12/2023 onwards
2. I need to find **fulfilled orders** (which means "Complete" status, not "Pending" or "Canceled")
3. I need to calculate the total amount spent on those fulfilled orders

From the current visible orders on page 1, I can see:
- Orders from 5/17/23, 5/2/23 (multiple) - these are within the past month
- Orders from 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23 - these are older than a month

The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", meaning there are more orders to review. I need to check all pages to find all fulfilled orders from the past month. Let me scroll down to see if there are more orders visible, or I should navigate through the pages systematically.

Let me first check what fulfilled orders are visible on this page and then navigate to the next pages to ensure I capture all orders from the past month.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the order history table with 10 orders displayed. The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", meaning there are more orders across multiple pages.

Let me analyze what I need to do:
1. Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means orders from 5/12/2023 onwards
2. I need to find only **fulfilled orders** (status = "Complete")
3. Calculate the total amount spent on those fulfilled orders

From the visible orders on page 1, the ones from the past month (5/12/2023 onwards) are:
- 5/17/23: Order 000000170 - $365.42 - **Canceled** (not fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Orders 000000189, 000000188, 000000187 - all **Pending** (not fulfilled)

The older orders (before 5/12/23) don't count for "past month".

Since there are 37 total orders and I'm only seeing 10 per page, I need to check all pages to ensure I capture all fulfilled orders from the past month. Let me navigate to page 2 to see more orders.

```click("1492")```

Looking at the current page state, I'm on page 2 of the order history. The page shows "Items 11 to 20 of 37 total" and displays orders from January 2023 and earlier (1/29/23, 1/16/23, 12/18/22, etc.).

Let me analyze the situation:
- Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means orders from 5/12/2023 onwards
- All orders visible on page 2 are from January 2023 and December 2022, which are all older than the past month
- I need to go back to page 1 to review the orders from the past month more carefully

From my previous observations on page 1, the orders from the past month (5/12/2023 onwards) were:
- 5/17/23: Order 000000170 - $365.42 - Canceled (NOT fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Orders 000000189, 000000188, 000000187 - all Pending (NOT fulfilled)

Since page 2 and beyond contain only older orders (before 5/12/2023), I should go back to page 1 to verify the exact status of all orders from the past month. Let me navigate back to page 1.

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I need to reconsider my approach.

Let me analyze what I've learned:
1. Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means orders from 5/12/2023 onwards
2. I need to find **fulfilled orders** (status = "Complete")
3. I need to calculate the total amount spent

From page 1 (which I reviewed), the orders from the past month (5/12/2023 onwards) were:
- 5/17/23: Order 000000170 - $365.42 - **Canceled** (NOT fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Orders 000000189, 000000188, 000000187 - all **Pending** (NOT fulfilled)

Page 2 showed older orders from January and December 2022, which are outside the past month.

The issue is that I haven't found any **fulfilled** (Complete status) orders from the past month yet. Let me go back to page 1 to double-check all the orders and their statuses carefully. I may have missed something or need to verify the exact dates and statuses.

```click("1488")```

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I need to carefully analyze the order history to find fulfilled orders from the past month.

Let me review what I know:
- Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means orders from 5/12/2023 onwards
- I need to find orders with status "Complete" (fulfilled)
- I need to calculate the total amount spent on those orders

From the accessibility tree provided, I can see the orders on page 1:
- 5/17/23: Order 000000170 - $365.42 - **Canceled** (not fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Order 000000189 - $754.99 - **Pending** (not fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Order 000000188 - $2,004.99 - **Pending** (not fulfilled)
- 5/2/23: Order 000000187 - $1,004.99 - **Pending** (not fulfilled)
- 3/11/23: Order 000000180 - $65.32 - **Complete** (fulfilled, but before past month)
- 3/10/23: Order 000000166 - $17.99 - **Complete** (fulfilled, but before past month)
- 2/27/23: Order 000000161 - $762.18 - **Complete** (fulfilled, but before past month)
- 2/24/23: Order 000000156 - $231.54 - **Canceled** (not fulfilled)
- 2/11/23: Order 000000158 - $174.99 - **Canceled** (not fulfilled)
- 2/9/23: Order 000000157 - $185.32 - **Complete** (fulfilled, but before past month)

Based on this analysis, there are **0 fulfilled orders from the past month (5/12/2023 onwards)**. All orders from the past month are either Canceled or Pending, and all Complete orders are from before the past month.

```send_msg_to_user("Based on my review of your order history, you have 0 fulfilled orders over the past month (since 5/12/2023). All orders from the past month are either Pending or Canceled. Therefore, the total amount spent on fulfilled orders in the past month is $0.00.")```
