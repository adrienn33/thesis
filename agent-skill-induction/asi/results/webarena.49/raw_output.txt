I need to find information about fulfilled orders over the past four months and calculate the total amount spent. Let me start by navigating to the My Account section to access order history.

The current date is 6/12/2023, so I need to look at orders from approximately 2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023 (4 months back).

Let me click on "My Account" to access the account page where I can view orders.

```click("227")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "My Account" page. I can see a "Recent Orders" table showing several orders, but I need to view ALL orders to properly count fulfilled orders over the past 4 months (from approximately 2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023).

I can see there's a "View All" link next to the "Recent Orders" heading. Let me click on that to see the complete order history.

I need to analyze the current page state to find fulfilled orders from the past 4 months and calculate the total spent.

Looking at the accessibility tree, I'm already on the "My Orders" page (http://localhost:7770/sales/order/history/). I can see a table with orders listed. Let me analyze what I see:

**Current visible orders on Page 1:**
1. Order 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - **Canceled**
2. Order 000000189 - 5/2/23 - $754.99 - **Pending**
3. Order 000000188 - 5/2/23 - $2,004.99 - **Pending**
4. Order 000000187 - 5/2/23 - $1,004.99 - **Pending**
5. Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32 - **Complete** ✓
6. Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99 - **Complete** ✓
7. Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18 - **Complete** ✓
8. Order 000000156 - 2/24/23 - $231.54 - **Canceled**
9. Order 000000158 - 2/11/23 - $174.99 - **Canceled**
10. Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32 - **Complete** ✓

The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" and there are 4 pages. I need to check all pages to find all fulfilled (Complete) orders within the 4-month window (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023).

Let me navigate to page 2 to see more orders.

```click("1492")```

Looking at the current page, I'm on Page 2 of the order history. I can see orders from January and December 2022, which are outside the 4-month window I need (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023).

Let me analyze what I've found so far:

**From Page 1 (already viewed):**
Fulfilled orders within 4 months (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023):
- Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32 - Complete ✓
- Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99 - Complete ✓
- Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18 - Complete ✓
- Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32 - Complete ✓

**From Page 2 (current view):**
All visible orders are from 2022 (October-January), which are outside the 4-month window.

Since Page 2 shows orders from 2022 and the 4-month window ends at 2/12/2023, I need to go back to Page 1 to verify I have all the orders within the timeframe. Let me navigate back to Page 1.

```click("1492")```

Looking at my past actions, I can see that I've already navigated through the order pages. Let me analyze what I found:

**From Page 1 - Orders within the 4-month window (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023):**

Fulfilled (Complete) orders:
1. Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32 - Complete ✓
2. Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99 - Complete ✓
3. Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18 - Complete ✓
4. Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32 - Complete ✓

**From Page 2:**
All orders were from 2022, outside the 4-month window.

However, I notice the page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" with 4 pages available. I should verify by checking if there are any more fulfilled orders on pages 3 and 4 that might fall within the 4-month window. Let me go back to page 1 first to ensure I have the complete picture.

Looking at my past actions and the current page state, I can see I'm on the "My Orders" page showing orders from the order history. 

Let me analyze what I need to do:
1. I need to find all **fulfilled (Complete)** orders from the past 4 months (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023)
2. Calculate the total amount spent on those orders
3. The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" with 4 pages

From my previous observations on Page 1, I found these fulfilled orders within the 4-month window:
- Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32 - Complete
- Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99 - Complete
- Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18 - Complete
- Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32 - Complete

I also saw that Page 2 had orders from 2022 (outside the window). However, I should check pages 3 and 4 to be thorough, as there might be more recent fulfilled orders. Let me navigate to page 3 to check for any additional fulfilled orders within the timeframe.

```click("1496")```

Looking at the current page state, I'm on Page 3 of the order history. The page shows orders from 2022 (October-July), which are all outside the 4-month window I need (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023).

Let me review what I've found so far:

**Page 1:** Had orders from 2023 (May, March, February) - found 4 fulfilled orders within the 4-month window
**Page 2:** Had orders from 2022 (January-October) - outside the window
**Page 3 (current):** Has orders from 2022 (October-July) - outside the window

Since the orders are sorted chronologically with newest first, and Page 3 shows only 2022 orders, I should check Page 4 to be thorough, but it's likely to also be outside the window. However, let me verify by going back to Page 1 to confirm my findings and ensure I have the complete and accurate data.

Looking at my past actions and the current page state, I can see I've been navigating through the order pages. Let me analyze what I've found:

**From Page 1 - Orders within the 4-month window (2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023):**

Fulfilled (Complete) orders:
1. Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32 - Complete ✓
2. Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99 - Complete ✓
3. Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18 - Complete ✓
4. Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32 - Complete ✓

**Pages 2 and 3:** Contained orders from 2022, which are outside the 4-month window.

Since the orders are sorted with newest first, and I've confirmed that Page 2 and 3 contain only 2022 orders (outside the window), I have found all fulfilled orders within the past 4 months.

Let me calculate the total:
- $65.32 + $17.99 + $762.18 + $185.32 = $1,030.81

Now I'll send this information to the user:

```send_msg_to_user("Based on my review of your order history, you have 4 fulfilled orders over the past four months (from 2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023):\n\n1. Order 000000180 - 3/11/23 - $65.32\n2. Order 000000166 - 3/10/23 - $17.99\n3. Order 000000161 - 2/27/23 - $762.18\n4. Order 000000157 - 2/9/23 - $185.32\n\nTotal amount spent on fulfilled orders: $1,030.81")```
