I need to find information about fulfilled orders from the past three days (from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023) and calculate the total amount spent. Let me start by navigating to the account page to access order history.

First, I'll click on "My Account" to view the account information and order history.

I can see the current page is already showing the "My Account" page with a "Recent Orders" table visible. The table shows several orders with dates and statuses. However, I need to see all orders to find those from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023) that are fulfilled.

Looking at the visible orders:
- Order 000000170: 5/17/23 - Canceled
- Order 000000189: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000188: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000187: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000180: 3/11/23 - Complete

None of these are from the past three days (6/9-6/12/2023). I need to click "View All" to see the complete order history.

```click('1416')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the "My Orders" page showing order history. The visible orders are from earlier dates (May, March, February 2023), but I need to find orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023).

Let me analyze what I see:
- The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" orders
- Current visible orders are all from earlier dates
- There are pagination controls showing Pages 1-4 available
- The orders shown are from May, March, and February 2023

Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023), these would be the most recent orders. They should appear on the first page or early pages. However, the visible orders are much older.

Let me scroll down to see if there are more recent orders below the currently visible ones, or I may need to check if the orders are sorted in a way that shows older orders first.

```scroll(0, 300)```

The issue is that the orders appear to be sorted with older orders first. I need to look for more recent orders. Let me check if there are any orders from 6/9-6/12/2023 by examining the complete order list. Since the page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", I should increase the items per page to see more orders at once, which will help me identify all orders from the past three days.

Let me set the items per page to 50 to see more orders:

```set_items_per_page('1509', '50')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the "My Orders" page is displaying a table with orders. The visible orders are from May, March, and February 2023. Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023), I need to find the most recent orders.

Let me analyze the current situation:
1. The page shows 37 total items
2. The items per page dropdown is set to 50, so all orders should be visible
3. The orders appear to be sorted with older orders first (May 2023 at the top)
4. I need to look for orders from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023

Since the orders are sorted with older dates first, the most recent orders should be at the bottom of the list. Let me scroll down to find orders from the past three days (6/9-6/12/2023).

```scroll(0, -500)```

The key observation is that the orders appear to be sorted with older dates at the top. The most recent orders should be at the bottom of the list. However, I notice that the visible orders don't include any from June 2023 at all - they jump from May 2023 to March 2023.

This suggests that there may not be any orders from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023 in the order history. Let me scroll to the very bottom of the orders table to check if there are any more recent orders that I haven't seen yet.

```scroll(0, -1000)```

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I can see:

1. I'm on the "My Orders" page showing order history
2. The visible orders are from May, March, and February 2023
3. Today is 6/12/2023, and I need orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023)
4. The orders appear to be sorted with older dates first
5. I've scrolled but haven't found any orders from June 2023

The critical issue is that I don't see ANY orders from June 2023 in the visible list. The most recent orders shown are from May 2023. This suggests that either:
- There are no orders from 6/9-6/12/2023, or
- The orders are sorted in reverse chronological order and I need to scroll to the very top

Let me scroll to the very top of the page to check if there are any recent orders from June 2023:

```scroll(0, -2000)```

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I can see:

1. I'm on the "My Orders" page showing order history
2. The visible orders in the accessibility tree are from May, March, and February 2023
3. Today is 6/12/2023, and I need orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023)
4. The orders appear to be sorted with older dates first (May at top, going back to March, February, etc.)
5. I haven't found any orders from June 2023 yet

The key insight is that the orders are sorted chronologically with older orders appearing first. Since I need the most recent orders (from 6/9-6/12/2023), they should be at the very beginning of the list, but I'm currently seeing May 2023 orders at the top.

Let me scroll to the absolute top of the orders table to see if there are any June 2023 orders:

```scroll(0, -3000)```

The critical observation is that the most recent orders shown are from 5/17/2023, and there are NO orders from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023 visible in the entire order history table.
