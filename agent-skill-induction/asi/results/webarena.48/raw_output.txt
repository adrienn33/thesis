Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the "My Orders" page with a table showing order history. I can see orders from various dates, but I need to find fulfilled orders from the past three days (6/9/2023, 6/10/2023, and 6/11/2023).

From the visible orders on the current page, I can see:
- Order 000000170: 5/17/23, $365.42, Canceled
- Order 000000189: 5/2/23, $754.99, Pending

- Order 000000180: 3/11/23, $65.32, Complete
- Order 000000166: 3/10/23, $17.99, Complete
- Order 000000161: 2/27/23, $762.18, Complete

- Order 000000157: 2/9/23, $185.32, Complete

None of these orders are from the past three days (6/9-6/11/2023). The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", so there are more orders. I need to scroll down or check other pages to find orders from 6/9/2023, 6/10/2023, or 6/11/2023. Let me scroll down to see if there are more recent orders below.

The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" with pagination controls. Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from the past three days, those would be the most recent orders. The current view shows older orders, so I need to look for more recent orders. Let me scroll up to see if there are more recent orders at the top of the table, or I should check if there's a way to sort by date in descending order.

Since the orders appear to be sorted with older orders first, the most recent orders are likely at the END of the list, not the beginning. I need to navigate to the last pages to find the most recent orders from the past three days.

Let me click on "Page 4" (the last page shown in the pagination) to see if the most recent orders are there.

The most recent orders would typically be on page 1 (the first page), not on page 2. Let me navigate to page 1 to see the most recent orders.

Looking at the current page state, I'm back on page 1 of the order history. I can see orders from May, March, and February 2023, but I need to find orders from the past three days (6/9/2023, 6/10/2023, and 6/11/2023).

The issue is that the orders displayed are older than what I'm looking for. Today is 6/12/2023, so orders from 6/9-6/11/2023 should be very recent. However, the current view shows orders from May and earlier.

Let me think about this differently: If the most recent orders are not visible on page 1, they might be on a different page. But I notice the pagination shows pages 1-4, and I've checked pages 1 and 2 without finding recent orders from June 2023.

Let me scroll up to the very top of the page to see if there are any orders displayed above the current table view that might be from the past three days.

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I can see that:

1. I'm on the "My Orders" page showing a table of orders
2. The visible orders are from May, March, and February 2023
3. Today is 6/12/2023, so I need orders from 6/9/2023, 6/10/2023, and 6/11/2023
4. The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" with pagination

The problem is that the orders displayed are older than what I'm looking for. The most recent orders from June 2023 should be somewhere in this list of 37 orders, but they're not visible on the current pages I've checked.

Let me reconsider: If today is 6/12/2023 and the orders shown are from May and earlier, it's possible that:
1. There are no orders from the past three days, OR
2. The orders are sorted in a way that puts older orders first, and I need to find the most recent ones

Let me scroll down to see the complete table and check if there are any orders from June 2023 that I might have missed, or if I need to look at the table more carefully.
