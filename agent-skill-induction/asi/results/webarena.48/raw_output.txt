I need to find information about fulfilled orders from the past three days (from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023) and calculate the total amount spent. Let me start by navigating to the account page to access order history.

First, I'll click on "My Account" to view the account information and order history.

I can see the current page is already showing the "My Account" page with a "Recent Orders" table visible. The table shows several orders with dates and statuses. However, I need to see all orders to find those from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023) that are fulfilled.

Looking at the visible orders:
- Order 000000170: 5/17/23 - Canceled
- Order 000000189: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000188: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000187: 5/2/23 - Pending
- Order 000000180: 3/11/23 - Complete

None of these are from the past three days (6/9-6/12/2023). I need to click "View All" to see the complete order history.

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the "My Orders" page showing order history. The visible orders are from earlier dates (May, March, February 2023), but I need to find orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023).

Let me analyze what I see:
- The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" orders
- There are pagination controls showing Pages 1-4
- The current visible orders are all from earlier dates
- I need to look for orders from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023 with "Complete" or "Fulfilled" status

Since the orders shown are from earlier dates and I need more recent orders, I should check if there are more recent orders by scrolling or checking other pages. However, it's more efficient to use the available MCP tool to search for orders directly. Let me search for products or use the server functions to get order information.

Actually, looking at the accessibility tree more carefully, I notice the orders are listed in reverse chronological order (oldest first in the visible list). The most recent orders would be at the beginning. Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from 6/9-6/12/2023, and I don't see any orders from June in the current view, let me scroll up to see if there are more recent orders above the current view, or I should check if the page needs to load more data.

Let me scroll up to see if there are more recent orders at the top of the table:

```scroll(0, -300)```

2. The orders might be on a different page or need to be loaded

Let me scroll up to the top of the page to see if there are more recent orders that might not be visible in the current viewport:

Let me scroll to the very top of the page to ensure I'm seeing the most recent orders:

Looking at the current state, I'm on the "My Orders" page showing orders from May, March, and February 2023. The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" orders.

Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from the past three days (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023), I notice that the visible orders are all from earlier dates. This is unusual - typically the most recent orders would appear first.

Let me think about this:
1. The orders shown are: 5/17/23, 5/2/23, 5/2/23, 5/2/23, 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23
2. None of these are from June 9-12, 2023
3. The page shows 37 total orders across 4 pages

It's possible that:
- There are no orders from the past three days, OR
- The orders are sorted in a way that shows older orders first

Let me check if I can view the orders in a different order or if there's a way to filter by date. First, let me scroll back to the top of the page to see the full table header and any sorting options:

```scroll(0, -2000)```

Let me think about this systematically:
1. The visible orders are all from May 2023 or earlier
2. There are 37 total orders across 4 pages
3. If the most recent orders are at the end of the list, I should check the last page

However, it's more efficient to use the available MCP server functions to directly query the order data. Let me search for orders or get product/order information using the available tools. But first, let me check if there's a way to see all orders or filter by date.

Actually, looking at the table structure, I notice the orders might be sorted in ascending date order (oldest first). If that's the case, the most recent orders would be on the last page. Let me navigate to page 4 to see if there are more recent orders there:

Looking at the current state, I'm on page 4 of the order history, which shows orders from June, May, March, and February 2022 - these are all from 2022, not 2023.

The issue is that the orders are sorted with the oldest orders first. Since today is 6/12/2023 and I need orders from 6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023, I need to find the most recent orders. The page shows "Items 31 to 37 of 37 total", meaning page 4 contains the last orders in the system.

Looking at the visible orders on page 4:
- 6/30/22 - Canceled
- 5/22/22 - Complete
- 4/27/22 - Complete
- 4/5/22 - Complete
- 3/10/22 - Canceled
- 3/2/22 - Canceled
- 3/2/22 - Complete

All of these are from 2022, not 2023. This suggests there may be no orders from June 2023 in the system, or the dates shown are in MM/DD/YY format and I need to reconsider.

Wait - looking more carefully at the dates, they show "6/30/22", "5/22/22", etc. These are all from 2022. But I also saw earlier orders like "5/17/23" which would be May 17, 2023.

Let me go back to page 1 to systematically review all orders and identify which ones are from June 2023 (6/9/2023 to 6/12/2023):
