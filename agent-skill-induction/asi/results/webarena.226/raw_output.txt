I need to find the price range for products from Amazon Basics. Let me search for Amazon Basics products using the available search functionality.

First, I'll use the product search function to find Amazon Basics products and get their price information.

```
magento_product_server_search_products(name="Amazon Basics")
```

This will search for all products with "Amazon Basics" in the name and return their information including prices, which will help me determine the price range.

I can see from the history that I've already attempted to search for Amazon Basics products using the `magento_product_server_search_products` function multiple times. Let me try a different approach - I'll search using the search bar on the current page to find Amazon Basics products and see their prices.

Let me use the search functionality on the page:

```
search_for_product('272', 'Amazon Basics')
```

This will search for Amazon Basics products on the store and display the results with their prices, allowing me to determine the price range.

Looking at the current page, I can see search results for "Amazon Basics" products are already displayed. The page shows 12 products with their prices visible. Let me analyze the prices shown on this page and then check if there are more products on other pages to determine the complete price range.

From the current page, I can see these prices:
- $7.38
- $42.56
- $31.83
- $29.05
- $9.60
- $171.52
- $10.30
- $5.49
- $8.77
- $22.29
- $6.33
- $216.32

However, the page indicates there are 7,332 total Amazon Basics products. To get a comprehensive price range, let me use the product search function to get more detailed pricing information:

```
magento_product_server_search_products(name="Amazon Basics", limit=100)
```

This will retrieve up to 100 Amazon Basics products with their pricing information, which will give me a better understanding of the overall price range across the catalog.

To get a comprehensive price range for all Amazon Basics products, I should use the product search function with a higher limit to analyze pricing across a larger sample:

```
magento_product_server_search_products(name="Amazon Basics", limit=100)
```

This will retrieve up to 100 Amazon Basics products with their pricing information, allowing me to determine the minimum and maximum prices across a representative sample of the catalog.
